# Chapter 1: Operating system interfaces

- Context: [[2022__ckm__xv6-riscv-rev3]]

## Notes

- Job of an OS
	- Manages and abstracts hardware
	- Shares the hardware among multiple programs (virtualization)
	- Provide controlled ways for programs to interact (IPC)

### 1.1 Processes and memory

- xv6 process memory = user-space memory + per-process state in kernel
- Multi-processing: time-sharing
- System calls
	- `fork`
	- `int wait(int *status)`
		- `wait((int *) 0)` means not caring about the exit status of a child.

### 1.2 I/O and File descriptors

### 1.3 Pipes

### 1.4 File system

### 1.5 Real world

- POSIX
- Plan 9
	- Applied "resources are files" to "everything"
- Multics
	- A predecessor of Unix
	- Abstracted file like memory
	- Too complicated that influenced Unix to build something simpler
- xv6
	- Not POSIX compliant
	- No notion of users (always root)
