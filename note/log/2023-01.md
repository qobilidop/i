## Day 01

Activities:

- Practiced some Spanish on Duolingo.
- Started [practicing on the LLVM Kaleidoscope tutorial](https://github.com/qobilidop/practice-llvm-kaleidoscope).
  - Finished chapter 1 and scanned over the rest. I feel [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) is a better fit for me right now. So I'll pause this and switch over to that tomorrow.
- Practiced running: 26:03 / 3.94 km = 6:37 /km.
- Listened to [Podcast | Software Engineering Daily | API Observability with Jean Yang](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2022/12/30/api-observability-with-jean-yang/).
- 在听[【梵高 Mone¥Talk】新年首波毒奶：亚洲金融危机 2.0 的脚步声迫近？](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/63b03612e7ab859986035b3d).
- Played some GeoGuessr.

Bookmarks:

- Cornell [CS 6120: Advanced Compilers γ](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2020fa/self-guided/): Looks pretty interesting. I'll finish a basic compiler course first and go over this one.
