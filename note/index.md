# Bili's Notebook

Hi, I'm [Bili](https://qobilidop.dev). This is my personal notebook, built with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

I'm publishing it in the open with the hope that someone else might occasionally find something useful here.

Be warned that I might change my note structure dramatically from time to time, so don't rely on any link to any page. They are almost destined to break. If you find anything useful here, feel free to let me know. I could export the content to a more permanent format, like a blog post.

## Entrypoints

Professionally, I'm currently focusing on [[p4|P4]] and [[smartnic|SmartNIC]] in the background of [[dcn|data center networking]].

In my off-work hours, I'm broadly interested in [[sys|computer systems]] and [[pl|programming languages]].

I also keep a [[log]] to record some of my life.
