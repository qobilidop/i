## Entrypoints

Professionally, I'm currently focusing on [[p4|P4]] and [[smartnic|SmartNIC]] in depth, and [[data-center-networking|data center networking]] in breadth.

In my off-work hours, I tried to learn [[computer-systems|computer systems]] better. I wasn't a computer science major in undergrad and kind of rushed through a master's in computer science under the pressure to find a job. Now that I don't have the job pressure, it's time for me to learn all these topics in the best way I could think of, which is to implement a toy version of all these fundamental system softwares and hardware designs.

Outside of these systematic study, I enjoy learning random things, consuming whatever interests me, and leaving [[latest|marks]] sometimes.
